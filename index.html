              <p>In Omio, <strong>I developed all campaigns</strong> in collaboration with Marketing and Design Team colleagues. Creatives would then be used in different channels like: Facebook, Google Ads, Apps and CRM.</p>

              <p><strong>Process Designer:</strong></p>

              <p>At the time I started in Omio, I was alone in the Marketing department. So I had to set up a bunch of <strong>rules and tools</strong> so I could be more productive. I created a process with different steps (kick off, briefing,
                review and follow up). Then, we <strong>prioritized tasks</strong> by channel and deadline. Finally, we would only use one communication tool.</p>

              <p>The files, which the designers worked on, and the ones shared with the Marketing fellows, always had the same <strong>folder structure</strong> and everyone used a <strong>naming convention</strong>.</p>

              <p><strong>Rebranding:</strong></p>

              <p>After a year in Omio, management wanted to expand outside Europe, so we needed a <strong>full rebranding</strong>. Goeuro was the old name and it changed to Omio. This was a massive effort that took some months to finish…</p>

              <p>My role during rebranding was to list down how many creatives were live at the moment and hat to be replaced. I also helped hiring external <strong>freelancers</strong> so they could help us. I made sure all what they delivered was
                good to go live again.</p>

              <p>After two years the Design Team grew from four to at least <strong>twenty members</strong>. My role changed, I helped new joiners adapt and encourage them to improve the rules in place. Also had some initiatives and presentations to
                improve the <strong>team spirit</strong>.</p>
